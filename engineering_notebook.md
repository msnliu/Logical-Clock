Design choice:

1. The LamportClock class is designed to provide a logical clock implementation with three methods: increment, update, and get_time. These methods are used to increment the clock value, update the clock with the maximum of other_time and the current time, and get the current clock time, respectively. A threading lock is used to ensure thread-safe access to the clock value.

2. The VirtualMachine class is designed to represent each virtual machine instance and contain all the logic required to run the simulation. It contains methods for connecting to other machines, sending messages, and running the virtual machine. It also contains a message queue and a log file for tracking the messages and events that occur during the simulation. Each VirtualMachine instance also has its own LamportClock instance with a random tick rate between 1 and 6.

3. The run method of the VirtualMachine class runs the main logic of the simulation. It starts by creating a list of two sockets connected to other machines and then enters an infinite loop. If there are messages in the message queue, it processes them by updating the local clock value with the maximum of other_time and the current time plus one, logging the received message, and removing the message from the queue. If there are no messages, it randomly selects one of four possible actions: sending a message to the first machine, sending a message to the second machine, sending messages to both machines with a random delay between them, or incrementing the local clock value and logging an internal event. The clock value is incremented after each action, and a wait method is called to sleep for a random amount of time based on the tick rate of the LamportClock instance.

4. The init_machine function is used to initialize the server-side logic for each VirtualMachine instance. It creates a socket and binds it to the specified port, listens for incoming connections, and starts a new thread to handle each incoming connection. When a new connection is accepted, it starts a new thread to receive messages on that connection and logs the connection.

5. The machine function is used to create and run a new VirtualMachine instance. It creates the instance with the specified configuration and ID, starts a new thread to initialize the server-side logic, and then starts a new thread to run the main logic of the simulation. A delay is added to allow time for the server-side logic to initialize before the main logic starts running.

6. For each process, we created a listening thread and sending thread. For each of these threads, we created a socket correpsoding to them. Therefore, in total, we have 6 threads and 6 sockets with a one to one mapping.

Debug process:

1. Our first bug was that the generated log files had no output available. We checked the threads for receiving messages and found that we haven't created threads for each machine to receive messages. Therefore, we added one listening thread for each process to constantly receive messages from other two processes.

2. Our second bug was that we had encounted assigned address already in use error when running our code. The fix turned out to be adding a clock wait after the while loop in the function run so that we gave the clock enough time for it to finish the designated event before requesting next connection.

3. Our third bug was that we found the logical clock time fluctuates in our log files which indicated that the ordering of our events was not sequential and did not follow partial ordering. Since we noticed that the fluctuations appeared in receiving messages, we checked our implementation for receiving messages and did the following two changes: First, we changed the logical clock time from time_val to self.clock.get_time() because we wanted to use the updated clock time as the final logical clock time shown on the log files. Second, we deleted the clock update in the physical receive of messages (append to the machine's queue). We only kept the clock update in the logical receive of messages (popping the message out of the queue)

4. Our fourth bug was that we would always create one socket per send_message by initializing a new connection the machine we wanted to send the message to and getting that connection. This turned out to be unnecessary and inefficient as we only needed one socket for each thread (either send or receive). Therefore, we created a bucket of sockets only once per run and used the corresponding sockets later by indexing into the previously created sockets list.
